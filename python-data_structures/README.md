Welcome to the "Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples" project! This project introduces you to two fundamental data structures in Python: **lists** and **tuples**. You will learn how to use them effectively, understand their differences, and leverage their specific advantages.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand what lists are and how to use them.
- Identify the differences and similarities between strings and lists.
- Use the most common methods of lists in Python.
- Use lists as stacks and queues.
- Implement list comprehensions for concise and readable code.
- Understand what tuples are and how to use them.
- Know when to use tuples versus lists.
- Understand the concept of a sequence in Python.
- Perform tuple packing and unpacking.
- Use the `del` statement to remove elements from a list.

## Requirements

- **Python Scripts:**
  - All scripts will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
  - All files must end with a new line.
  - The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
  - All Python files must be executable.
  - Your code should follow the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.7).
- **Editors:**
  - You can use any of the following text editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Print a List of Integers
- **Function**: `print_list_integer(my_list=[])`
- Prints all integers in a list, one per line, using `str.format()`.

### 1. Secure Access to an Element in a List
- **Function**: `element_at(my_list, idx)`
- Retrieves an element from a list at a specified index.

### 2. Replace Element
- **Function**: `replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element)`
- Replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

### 3. Print a List of Integers in Reverse
- **Function**: `print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[])`
- Prints all integers of a list in reverse order.

### 4. Replace in a Copy
- **Function**: `new_in_list(my_list, idx, element)`
- Replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

### 5. Can You C Me Now?
- **Function**: `no_c(my_string)`
- Removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string.

### 6. Lists of Lists = Matrix
- **Function**: `print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]])`
- Prints a matrix of integers.

### 7. Tuples Addition
- **Function**: `add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=())`
- Adds two tuples element-wise.

### 8. More Returns!
- **Function**: `multiple_returns(sentence)`
- Returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

### 9. Find the Max
- **Function**: `max_integer(my_list=[])`
- Finds the biggest integer in a list.

### 10. Only by 2
- **Function**: `divisible_by_2(my_list=[])`
- Finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

### 11. Delete at
- **Function**: `delete_at(my_list=[], idx=0)`
- Deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

### 12. Switch
- Switch the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.
