Python - if/else, loops, functions

Welcome to the "Python - if/else, loops, functions" project! This project is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of Python programming, specifically focusing on control flow, loops, and functions.
Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

    Understand the importance of indentation in Python.
    Use if, if...else statements for conditional execution.
    Write and use comments effectively in your code.
    Assign values to variables and understand their scope.
    Use while and for loops to repeat tasks.
    Utilize break and continue statements within loops.
    Use else clauses on loops.
    Understand the purpose of the pass statement and when to use it.
    Utilize the range function for generating sequences.
    Understand what functions are and how to define and use them.
    Know what a function returns when no return statement is used.
    Understand the scope of variables within functions.
    Identify and understand Python tracebacks.
    Use arithmetic operators in Python.

Requirements

    Python Scripts:
        All scripts will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.
        Scripts must end with a new line.
        The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
        All files must be executable.
        Your code should follow the pycodestyle style guide (version 2.7).
    Editors:
        You can use any of the following text editors: vi, vim, or emacs.

Tasks
0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

    Write a program that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.
    File: 0-positive_or_negative.py

1. The last digit

    Write a program that prints the last digit of a randomly assigned signed number and provides additional details based on the digit's value.
    File: 1-last_digit.py

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

    Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
    File: 2-print_alphabet.py

3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

    Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding 'q' and 'e'.
    File: 3-print_alphabt.py

4. Hexadecimal printing

    Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal format.
    File: 4-print_hexa.py

5. 00...99

    Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by commas, with each number formatted to two digits.
    File: 5-print_comb2.py

6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need

    Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
    File: 6-print_comb3.py

7. islower

    Write a function that checks for lowercase characters.
    File: 7-islower.py

8. To uppercase

    Write a function that prints a string in uppercase, followed by a new line.
    File: 8-uppercase.py

9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

    Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
    File: 9-print_last_digit.py

10. a + b

    Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
    File: 10-add.py

11. a ^ b

    Write a function that computes a to the power of b and returns the value.
    File: 11-pow.py

12. Fizz Buzz

    Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, with Fizz for multiples of three, Buzz for multiples of five, and FizzBuzz for multiples of both.
    File: 12-fizzbuzz.py

Advanced Tasks

There are additional advanced tasks in this project that will challenge you further:

    Print the alphabet in reverse order, alternating case.
    Remove a character from a string at a specific position.
    Perform other tasks that require a deeper understanding of Python.
