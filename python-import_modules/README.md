Python - Import & Modules

Welcome to the "Python - Import & Modules" project! This project is designed to help you understand how to use modules and functions in Python, as well as how to handle command-line arguments.
Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

    Understand why Python programming is powerful and versatile.
    Import functions from another file and use them effectively.
    Create and use a Python module.
    Utilize the built-in function dir() to explore the contents of a module.
    Prevent code in your script from being executed when the script is imported as a module.
    Use command-line arguments in your Python programs.

Requirements

    Python Scripts:
        All scripts will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS using Python 3.10.
        Scripts must end with a new line.
        The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
        All files must be executable.
        Your code should follow the pycodestyle style guide (version 2.7).
    Editors:
        You can use any of the following text editors: vi, vim, or emacs.

Resources

To assist you in completing this project, you can refer to the following resources:

Tasks
0. Import a simple function from a simple file

    Write a program that imports the function add(a, b) from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.
    File: 0-add.py

1. My first toolbox!

    Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, performs some mathematical operations, and prints the results.
    File: 1-calculation.py

2. How to make a script dynamic!

    Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed to it and the list of its arguments.
    File: 2-args.py

3. Infinite addition

    Write a program that prints the result of adding all command-line arguments.
    File: 3-infinite_add.py

4. Who are you?

    Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc.
    File: 4-hidden_discovery.py (must be placed in /tmp/ directory)

5. Everything can be imported

    Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.
    File: 5-variable_load.py
