Python - Classes and Objects

Welcome to the Python - Classes and Objects project! In this project, you will dive into the foundational concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. You will learn how to create classes, manage attributes, and work with methods. This project is essential for understanding how Python handles object creation and manipulation, and it will help you build a solid understanding of OOP principles.
Background Context

It’s important to read and understand all the resources provided in the order they are presented. The goal is to experiment and apply OOP concepts by yourself. Don’t just read—test, understand, and experiment with all the examples. The best way to learn is by doing!
Resources

Be sure to read or watch the following resources:

    Object-Oriented Programming
    Python Classes and Objects
    Properties vs Getters and Setters
    Python OOP: Object-Oriented Programming

Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without needing to use Google:
General

    What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
    What does "first-class everything" mean?
    What is a class?
    What is an object or instance?
    The difference between a class and an object/instance.
    What is an attribute?
    How to use public, protected, and private attributes.
    What is self in a class?
    What is a method, and how to use the __init__ method?
    What is data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding?
    What is a property in Python?
    The difference between an attribute and a property.
    How to dynamically create new attributes for existing instances of a class.
    How to bind attributes to objects and classes.
    What is the __dict__ of a class or instance, and what does it contain?
    How Python finds the attributes of an object or class.
    How to use the getattr function.

Requirements
Python Scripts

    Your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
    All your files should end with a new line.
    The first line of all your Python files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3.
    Your code should adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*) style guide.
    All your files must be executable.
    Each file, class, and method should contain a meaningful docstring explaining its purpose.

Documentation

    Each module, class, and method must have a detailed docstring (Python documentation).
    A documentation string is a sentence that explains the purpose of the code (its length will be verified).
    Use Google-style Python docstrings for clear documentation.

Tasks Overview
0. My first square

    Task: Write an empty class Square that defines a square.

1. Square with size

    Task: Write a class Square that defines a square with a private attribute size. Instantiate it with a size value but no type/value validation.

2. Size validation

    Task: Extend the Square class to include size validation. Ensure the size is an integer and greater than or equal to zero.

3. Area of a square

    Task: Add a public instance method area() to the Square class that calculates and returns the area of the square.

4. Access and update private attribute

    Task: Implement property methods for retrieving and setting the size attribute in the Square class.

5. Printing a square

    Task: Add a public instance method my_print() to the Square class to print a square with the # character.

6. Coordinates of a square

    Task: Add a new private instance attribute position, allowing control over where the square should be printed on the grid.

By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of object-oriented programming concepts in Python. Play around with the tasks and experiment with different attributes, methods, and properties to fully grasp how OOP works!

Happy coding!
