Welcome to the Python - Exceptions project! In this project, you will learn how to handle errors and exceptions in Python, ensuring that your programs run smoothly and robustly, even in the face of unexpected situations.
Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

    Understand why Python programming is awesome.
    Differentiate between errors and exceptions.
    Explain what exceptions are and how to use them.
    Identify when exceptions should be used.
    Correctly handle exceptions in your code.
    Understand the purpose of catching exceptions.
    Know how to raise built-in exceptions.
    Implement clean-up actions after an exception.

Requirements

    Python Scripts:
        All scripts will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
        All files should end with a new line.
        The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
        All Python files must be executable.
        Your code should follow the pycodestyle style guide (version 2.7).
    Editors:
        Allowed editors: vi, vim, or emacs.

Tasks Overview
0. Safe list printing

    Function: safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0)
    Prints x elements of a list and returns the real number of elements printed.

1. Safe printing of an integers list

    Function: safe_print_integer(value)
    Prints an integer and returns True if successful, otherwise False.

2. Print and count integers

    Function: safe_print_list_integers(my_list=[], x=0)
    Prints the first x elements of a list and only the integers. Returns the real number of integers printed.

3. Integers division with debug

    Function: safe_print_division(a, b)
    Divides two integers and prints the result. Returns the value of the division, or None if division cannot be performed.

4. Divide a list

    Function: list_division(my_list_1, my_list_2, list_length)
    Divides elements of two lists and returns a new list with the division results. Handles exceptions such as wrong type, division by zero, and out-of-range errors.

5. Raise exception

    Function: raise_exception()
    Raises a TypeError exception.

6. Raise a message

    Function: raise_exception_msg(message="")
    Raises a NameError exception with a specified message.

Additional Notes

    This project will enhance your ability to write robust Python programs that handle unexpected conditions gracefully.
    Remember to test your scripts thoroughly and adhere to the coding standards.

Happy coding!
