Welcome to the "Python - More Data Structures: Sets, Dictionaries" project! In this project, you will dive deeper into Python's powerful data structures â€” **sets** and **dictionaries**. You will learn how to utilize them to store, access, and manipulate data efficiently, and also understand the differences between these data structures and when to use them.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is awesome.
- Understand what sets are and how to use them.
- Use the most common methods for sets.
- Decide when to use sets versus lists.
- Iterate over elements in a set.
- Understand what dictionaries are and how to use them.
- Decide when to use dictionaries versus lists or sets.
- Define and use keys in a dictionary.
- Iterate over a dictionary.
- Understand what a lambda function is.
- Use `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions effectively.

## Requirements

- **Python Scripts:**
  - All scripts will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
  - All files should end with a new line.
  - The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
  - All Python files must be executable.
  - Your code should follow the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.7).
- **Editors:**
  - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Squared Simple
- **Function**: `square_matrix_simple(matrix=[])`
- Computes the square value of all integers in a matrix and returns a new matrix.

### 1. Search and Replace
- **Function**: `search_replace(my_list, search, replace)`
- Replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

### 2. Unique Addition
- **Function**: `uniq_add(my_list=[])`
- Adds all unique integers in a list (each integer is added only once).

### 3. Present in Both
- **Function**: `common_elements(set_1, set_2)`
- Returns a set of common elements in two sets.

### 4. Only Differents
- **Function**: `only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2)`
- Returns a set of elements present in only one set.

### 5. Number of Keys
- **Function**: `number_keys(a_dictionary)`
- Returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

### 6. Print Sorted Dictionary
- **Function**: `print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary)`
- Prints a dictionary sorted by keys.

### 7. Update Dictionary
- **Function**: `update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value)`
- Replaces or adds key/value pairs in a dictionary.

### 8. Simple Delete by Key
- **Function**: `simple_delete(a_dictionary, key="")`
- Deletes a key in a dictionary.

### 9. Multiply by 2
- **Function**: `multiply_by_2(a_dictionary)`
- Returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.

### 10. Best Score
- **Function**: `best_score(a_dictionary)`
- Returns a key with the highest integer value.

### 11. Multiply by Using Map
- **Function**: `multiply_list_map(my_list=[], number=0)`
- Returns a list with all values multiplied by a number using `map`.

### 12. Roman to Integer
- **Function**: `roman_to_int(roman_string)`
- Converts a Roman numeral to an integer.
