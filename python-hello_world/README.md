Python - Hello, World

Welcome to your first Python project! In this project, you'll get started with Python programming by learning some fundamental concepts and completing a series of tasks to reinforce your understanding.
Project Overview

This project introduces you to Python, one of the most popular high-level programming languages. Python is known for its readability, simplicity, and flexibility, making it a great choice for beginners and professionals alike.

You will learn how to use the Python interpreter, print text and variables, manipulate strings, understand indexing and slicing, and follow the official Python coding style using pycodestyle.
Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

    Use the Python interpreter to run Python scripts.
    Print text and variables using the print function.
    Understand and work with strings, including indexing and slicing.
    Follow the official Python coding style and check your code with pycodestyle.

Requirements

    All Python scripts should be written using Python 3.8 or later.
    All scripts must be executable and should start with the shebang #!/usr/bin/python3.
    Your code should follow the pycodestyle style guide (version 2.7.*).
    All files should be saved with a new line at the end.
    Use only vi, vim, or emacs editors to edit your files.
